            Hi, I'm Akshay. I'm a Front-end Web developer from Bangalore,
            Karnataka. <br />
            <br /> I love everything that has to do with Web design and
            development.
            <br /> I would like to be part of developing a new technology
            instead of just using it and Iâ€™m ready for visiting other countries
            and work for any company.
